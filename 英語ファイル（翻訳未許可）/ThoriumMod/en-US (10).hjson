				Title: To Be Continued...
				Description: Complete all other contracts to continue...
			}

			BoneLeeContract: {
				Title: Tracker's End
				Description: I've got a personal contract for you, kid. I don't ask this of you lightly, so please hear me out. Years ago, me and my partner, Lee, would take on the world together. We were an unstoppable duo, but made the grave error of underestimating a particularly difficult contract. In a desperate attempt to save me, he was struck down within the Dungeon halls where he surely rots. I've never forgiven myself for what happened... Please, go into the Dungeon and put his tortured soul to rest.
				DescriptionCompleted: You've done me a favor I could never repay in a thousand lifetimes. What I would give to apologize to Lee face to face... I'm confident, that at this point, you've surpassed any strength we thought we possessed. It's sobering to be humbled by an upstart like you, kid. As a reward, I've got a collection of weapons Lee would often use. I'm sure he would be honored if you wielded them in battle. Take care out there!
			}

			CursedContract: {
				Title: Enchanted Engagement
				Description: I'm sure you've seen that unregulated spirit magic can lead to a lot of things, such as possessed weapons and armor. That prospect alone is terrifying, but when powerful artifacts are possessed, things can get ugly... Keep your eyes peeled for aggressive Enchanted weapons deep underground.
			}

			DangerContract: {
				Title: Learning the Ropes
				Description: Alright kid, I think we should start you off easy... I've tracked down a group of wild creatures deep beneath our surface. On your adventures underground, you may encounter formidable creatures known as Crawdads, Salamanders and Giant Shellys. Taking out a couple of them would make the world a lot safer, and let me sleep peacefully for the night.
				DescriptionCompleted: Not bad at all, kid. Hopefully it wasn't too hard hunting one down. You may have noticed they dropped a '{$Items.VanquisherMedal.DisplayName}'. With those, you can redeem them for items I keep on me. Typically, they relate to the tracked creature, so be sure to visit me after completing any contracts.
			}

			DoctorContract: {
				Title: Arc of the Lost Raider
				Description: Many adventurers have braved the intense foliage of the jungle, but few ever return. I sent a friend of mine, {$NPCName.DoctorBones}, out on a mission to the jungle quite a while ago, but he hasn't returned... Could you go check out the jungle's surface at night and see if you can find any signs of him?
			}

			GildedContract: {
				Title: Pay Day
				Description: Radiant beasts have been spotted prowling underground Terraria, illuminating a path of ruin. The {$NPCs.GildedBat.DisplayName}, {$NPCs.GildedLycan.DisplayName}, and {$NPCs.GildedSlime.DisplayName} light up their surrounding area and pack quite a punch. It would be best if their numbers dwindled, even just a little...
			}

			HagContract: {
				Title: Haggard Hagglers
				Description: Many try to take shortcuts in their quest for power, often calling upon the elements for their boon. But while the elements can provide what they seek, it comes with a hefty price. There exists beings known as Hags that roam the world looking to steal back their traded youth. The Underworld, Jungle, Ocean, and Sky are the most likely spots to find one. Do us a favor and take one out.
			}

			HardmodeContract: {
				Title: To Be Continued...
				Description: Defeat the terrifying {$NPCName.WallofFlesh} to continue...
			}

			IceContract: {
				Title: Ice Breaker
				Description: Better pack some warm clothes for this one kid; this automaton, crafted from the coldest ice you can fathom, only appears in raging blizzards. Its deadly frost beams will freeze you solid if you aren't careful, so keep on the move and hide behind cover!
			}

			MimicContract: {
				Title: Fool's Gold
				Description: I don't know what you did out there, kid, but things have gotten a lot more hectic. With the released spirits possessing our world, you can't trust anything now! Worse yet, it seems some avarice spirits have possessed a collection of chests deep underground turning them into Mimics. Keep your eyes peeled for any chests laying around. They may not be what they seem...
			}

			MinotaurContract: {
				Title: Beast in the Maze
				Description: "{$Bestiary_Biomes.TheDungeon} is bad enough with skeletons and slimes roaming around, but with a {$NPCs.RagingMinotaur.DisplayName} loose, it gets even more complicated. That beast can charge at incredible speed, blindsiding anyone not paying attention and crippling their movement. Don't get staggered out there, kid."
			}

			MothContract: {
				Title: Gonna Need a Bigger Lamp
				Description: Don't be fooled, kid, the creature that lurks within the underground jungle is a being of pure terror, not beauty. Its mere existence is testament to our arrogance as individuals. It's... a moth!
			}

			MothronContract: {
				Title: Destroy All Monsters
				Description: When the moon perfectly blocks the sun, the terror within us is released upon the world. My biggest fear has manifested as well in the form of a mutant moth! Hey, we don't choose what we fear, kid...
			}

			NymphContract: {
				Title: Damsel of Distress
				Description: You've got a good heart, kid. Don't let that be the end of you with this contract... Deep within the snow caves, there hides a creature masquerading as a defenseless young girl. Once close enough, however, you'll see she's not so defenseless. Take her out if you find her!
			}

			PigronContract: {
				Title: Boared to Death
				Description: The Pigron are a rather bizarre hybrid of creatures. 50% pig, 50% dragon, and 100% evil. You might encounter them where the ice caverns meet the worlds evil. Beware their grumbling bellies as they approach; It's quite audible.
			}

			PinkyContract: {
				Title: Pinky, the World Ender
				Description: Never before have I heard of a creature with such terrifying power... It's pink, it's mean, and it journeys around with a powerful storm of slime. Destroy it!
			}

			PirateShipContract: {
				Title: Drunken Sailor's Query
				Description: Have you heard tale of the pirates and their insatiable lust for gold? They can smell a coin from miles around, and from the looks of it, you've got quite a few. I would keep on guard for their inevitable siege. Make them regret attacking here by breaking one of their {$NPCName.PirateShip} ships.
			}

			RecluseContract: {
				Title: Not so Itsy Bitsy
				Description: Alright kid, I've got a bit of a double contract for you this time; a lot of our fellow townsfolk have severe cases of arachnophobia it seems. Rumors of a '{$NPCs.BrownRecluseWall.DisplayName}' roaming the spider caverns have surfaced, but it seems like our only way to draw it out of hiding is to FIRST take down some kind of 'Gargantuan Ice Spider', which prowls the tundra during harsh blizzards. If you can defeat the ice spider, and then the brown recluse, the folks around here should feel a lot safer.
			}

			RuneContract: {
				Title: Rune Prune
				Description: The uncontrollable energies released by the Wall of Flesh's defeat have allowed some unsavory individuals to get quite a power boost. A rogue skeleton has harnessed the power of some long sealed spirits, and now terrorizes the underground as a Rune Wizard. His power is volatile and unpredictable; We can't allow him to live!
			}

			SandContract: {
				Title: Line in the Sand
				Description: An elemental's personality is heavily influenced by the environment it forms in. Considering sandstorms are rough, coarse, and dangerous, you can imagine why we would want to take down a few Sand Elementals. Watch your step for any nasty monsters wanting to take a bite out of you, kid!
			}

			TimContract: {
				Title: Casting a Shadow
				Description: I've managed to track down quite an elusive dark caster in the deeper levels of our world by the name of... {$NPCName.Tim}. Names aside, he's got quite a bit of power behind him, but one fatal weakness. It seems he's quite prideful of his outfit, thinking his better than any other. Maybe you should wear a gem robe to lure him out...?
			}

			WyvernContract: {
				Title: Off Cloud Nine
				Description: The winds of change are upon us it seems. But these winds don't seem to be in our favor... A nasty nest of Wyverns have found their way to the nearby sky islands floating just above our heads. I think it would be best for everyone if some of them were culled.
