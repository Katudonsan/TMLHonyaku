Bestiary: {
	TophatSquirrelCritter: This squirrel found itself a dapper hat! What will it do with this newfound power? Probably not much, honestly.
	GuttedCreeper: Continues to defend the heart of the Crimson even when it's stuffed in someone's pocket. They were bad, but now they're good!
	RoyalSubject: The growth of these would-be queens has been stunted. The pheromones emitted by their liege have summoned them to her aid.
	GelatinSubject: Elite guardians of the queen. They erect a magical barrier and give their lives to defend their liege.
	AbomSaucer: The cockpit is filled with machine parts. Abominationn commands these remote control turrets using a chip in his blaster cannon.
	LesserFairy: Drawn to the Champion of Life's radiance, these pixies care for nothing but fulfilling its commands.
	LesserSquirrel: These little critters helped build the Trojan Squirrel. Not aware of the small explosives attached to them.
	ShadowOrb: Clusters of darkness that focus its power. They keep the curtain of night drawn low in service of their master.
	ShadowOrbNPC: Clusters of darkness that focus its power. They keep the curtain of night drawn low in service of their master.
	TrojanSquirrel: Built by squirrels, for squirrels! Made of woods collected from numerous lands. It fits a lot more squirrels than it appears.
	GuardianOfAncientTreasures: Lurks deep underground, jealously guarding its horde of jewels and precious metals. Its scales are as hard as stone.
	CursedCoffin: A mindless fusion of over a hundred wicked souls. It feeds on the bodies of lost travellers and adds their spirits to itself.
	LifeChallenger: The brilliance emitting from its core is soothing but hypnotic. Holds sway over lesser organisms. Its true form cannot be perceived.
	Silhouette: An elusive being that always travels under cover of a black fog in the night. It feels sensitive when its true form is exposed.
	FrigidHydrangaea: This draconic beast hibernates in the frozen caverns, only waking when provoked. Should it really be living in the cold?
	BanishedBaron: Cast out from the hierarchy, it hid while it tried to repair itself. Imperfect work left its strength and speed hindered.
	MagmaConstruct: Overseer of the planet's core. It has taken over the underworld in the absence of the land's former master. It has no organic parts.
	TimberChampion: Channeling a Force has granted this wooden contraption fantastic power. But doesn't that squirrel in the cockpit look familiar?
	TerraChampion: Only the brain of this colossal serpent is still organic. Transformed into enchanted rock and metal, its body is impervious to attack.
	SpiritChampion: These lost souls regained higher intelligence by absorbing a Force. Not that it's going to stop eating humans any time soon.
	LifeChampion: Its feathers are said to be blessed relics that ward off nightmares. Has a low opinion of other lifeforms and is very territorial.
	ShadowChampion: Feeds on the negative emotions of other creatures. Breathing its fog is said to inflict an endless sleep fraught with nightmares.
	NatureChampion: This creature was driven from its home by a giant plant. Sometimes it thinks about going back, but the cold doesn't bother it anymore.
	WillChampion: Overflowing with rage. Strikes with great power and withstands attacks through sheer force of anger alone. Just who is this nameless exile?
	EarthChampion: Merging with a Force has given it a power high. This Champion erupts from the magma and rampages through all who cross its path.
	CosmosChampion: This noble warrior once travelled the stars in search of worthy opponents. It settled nearby after encountering a certain mutated trio.
	DeviBoss: Casts spells of light and love using a living axe made of evil. She must be very lax about death, given she never fights that hard to protect a town.
	AbomBoss: His blade divides the soul itself. All supernatural phenomena are his domain, but he doesn't use celestial attacks out of respect for Mutant.
	MutantBoss: The keeper of eternity. Ultimate power incarnate. Master of all with dominion over every aspect of combat. Perhaps it came from a world beyond that dimensional rift...

			Quote28: I CONTROL THE POWER THAT HAS REACHED FROM THE FAR ENDS OF THE UNIVERSE, UNITING DIMENSIONS, MANIPULATING TERRARIA, SLAYING MASOCHISTS, AND JUDGING HEAVENS! FOR CENTURIES I HAVE TRAINED FOR ONE GOAL ONLY: PURGE THE WORLD OF THE UNWORTHY, SLAY THE WEAK, AND BRING FORTH TRUE POWER. IN THE HIGHEST REACHES OF HEAVEN, MY BROTHER RULES OVER THE SKY! SOON, ALL OF TERRARIA WILL BE PURGED OF THE UNWORTH AND A NEW AGE WILL START! A NEW AGE OF AWESOME! A GOLDEN AGE WHERE ONLY ABSOLUTE BEINGS EXIST!DEATH, INFERNO, TIDE; I AM THE OMEGA AND THE ALPHA, THE BEGINNING AND THE END! ALMIGHTY POWER; REVELATIONS.ABSOLUTE BEING, ABSOLUTE PURITY.
			Quote29: WITHIN THE FOOLISH BANTERINGS OF THE MORTAL WORLD I HAVE ACHIEVED POWER THAT WAS ONCE BANISHED TO THE EDGE OF THE GALAXY! I BRING FORTH CALAMITIES, CATASTROPHES, AND CATACLYSM; ELDRITCH POWERS DERIVED FROM THE ABSOLUTE WORD OF FATE. FEEL MY UBIQUITOUS WRATH DRIVE YOU INTO THE GROUND AS A WORLD SHAPER DRIVES HIS WORLD INTO REALITY!
			Quote30: THE SHARPSHOOTER'S EYE PALES IN COMPARISON OF MY PERCEPTION OF REALITY! BERSERKERS RAGE NAUGHT BUT A BUNNIES! OLYMPIANS A MINOR GOD, ARCH WIZARDS A POSER! A MASTERY OF FLIGHT, THE IRON WILL OF A COLOSSUS; BOTH ELEMENTARY CONCEPTS! A CONJUROR BUT A PEDDLING MAGICIAN, A TRAWLER, A SLIVER COMPARED TO MY LIFE MASTERY? SUPERSONIC SPEED, LIGHTSPEED TIME! GLORIOUS LIGHT SHALL ELIMINATE YOU, YOU FOOLISH BUFFOON!!
			Quote31: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
